# compiler_design
This Repo is to learn about compiler design and learn its implementation.

First I am starting with desinging a interperter in go language. 

To do list;
    1. Our lexer only supports ASCII characters instead of full Unicode range. 
        1. In order to suport Unicode and UTF - 8 we need to change l.ch from byte to rune (int32)
